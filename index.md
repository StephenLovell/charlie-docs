<hr />

Charlie was born out of the desire to have a site that didn't need constant maintenance. It has less moving parts so there's less to upkeep. All your content is stored within flat [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) files, so it's easier to backup or customize.

And because it's so simple, it'll run anywhere PHP will, which means affordable hosting is easily found.

Themes are designed to be approachable, but also empower creatives to have more ownership over how their own sites behave and look. There's no need to know a programming language to take control of your theme. You just need to know or want to learn HTML & CSS.
